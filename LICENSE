### `CHANGELOG.md`

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## 1.1.0

- Switched auto-posting logic to `transition_post_status`:
  - Now supports any selected public post type, not just posts and pages.
- Added a centralised settings layer:
  - Introduced `get_default_settings()` and `get_settings()` to avoid undefined indexes.
  - Settings sanitisation now starts from defaults and overwrites values.
- Hardened embed building:
  - Strip shortcodes first, then strip HTML, then trim words for the excerpt.
  - Use a safe fallback for embed colour if sanitisation fails.
  - Use `get_gmt_from_date(..., 'c')` for proper ISO 8601 timestamps.
- Refined Discord webhook interaction:
  - Explicitly handle HTTP `204` as success.
  - Return structured success/error arrays from posting functions.
- Tidied meta box handling:
  - Centralised meta key into a class property.
  - Clarified manual post vs repost behaviour.
